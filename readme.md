# thorn
##### by rory (aka pinecat)

This is a simple program used for dumping hex values from binary files.  The name comes from the lead singer/guitarist of the Hex Girls from Scooby Doo.

Usage:
```
thorn [-c] [-n] [-x] [-l nperline] <filename>
```

To view what the options do, run:
```
thorn -h
```

thorn can be compiled on both Windows and Linux :D

Special thanks to [Adam](https://github.com/AdamRolek500/) for finding out ascii character 1a (substitute character) causes issues when reading binary files in Windows.
